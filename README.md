# Welcome to OpenJDK 21 Updates!

The JDK 21 Updates project uses two GitHub repositories.
Updates are continuously developed in the repository [jdk21u-dev](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk21u-dev). This is the repository usually targeted by contributors.
The [jdk21u](https://github.com/openjdk/jdk21u) repository is used for rampdown of the update releases of jdk21u and only accepts critical changes that must make the next release during rampdown. (You probably do not want to target jdk21u).

For more OpenJDK 21 updates specific information such as timelines and contribution guidelines see the [project wiki page](https://wiki.openjdk.org/display/JDKUpdates/JDK+21u/).
